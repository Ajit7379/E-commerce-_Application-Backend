# E-commerce_Application-Backend
Technologies Used: Core Java, Collections (HashMap), OOPs, Exception
Handling, Generics.
**Description:**
Developed a backend system for an E-Commerce application to manage
products efficiently using HashMap (ProductId → Product) for CRUD
operations. Implemented category-based filtering, sorting (price low-tohigh/high-to-low), and product aggregation using Core Java and Data
Structures.
**Key Features:**
✔ CRUD operations on various product types (Shirts, Mobiles, Laptops, etc.)
✔ Product filtering for type-based retrieval.
✔ Sorting products based on price (ascending & descending).
✔ Aggregated product counts by category, brand, size, and color.
✔ Efficient product retrieval and removal using ProductId.
This project demonstrates data handling, optimized search, and structured
inventory management using Java Collections.
